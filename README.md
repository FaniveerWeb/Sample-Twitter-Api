JH Twitter Api Test

Note:
I have added my twitter client keys inside the appsetting.json. Please feel free to change them and run the application.

Running Tips:
In swagger please execute the TwitterStream call first and keep it running. And then please execute the toptag end point and total tweets end point. You will notice that them showing variable results each time indicating the stream keeps on changing and we are getting variable results.


Thanks!
